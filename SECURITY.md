## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, open up an Issue on Project 'Trace -- Issues' and detail how it was discovered and how to go about finding it again.

Realistically, we will likely only update on reported vulnerabilities before the 27th of April, and even
that will be infrequent as we work on getting the project up and running before presentation day.

If a vulnerability is accepted, it will be worked on a new Branch from 'Main' for the sole purpose of solving that issue.

If it is declined, it will be removed from the 'Trace -- Issues' Project and not be worked on at this time.
