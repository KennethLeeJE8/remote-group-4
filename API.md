Trace is built with a Node.js backend to facilitate all manner of common functionality throughout the site.
This reference is written to help with identifying what all of our public endpoints are responsible for and how to go about using them.
  
If config.json has not been modified, these endpoints are accessible from http://localhost:3000 once the backend is up and running.  
See INSTALL.md for details on how to set up and run the backend.
