Jacob Dyer
----------
Visualization 1: Comparing API Endpoint Usage via Sequences Sunburst.
Visualization 2: Comparing API User Usage Metrics via Horizontal Bar Chart.

Worklog:
- Set up the Angular for the project.
- Devised a method to "plug and play" with routers and static directories.
    > SEE 'server.js' AND 'config.json' for more.

Creativity:
- As mentioned in item 2 of my worklog, I approached the problem of adding and removing
  routers and static directories from a different angle and made it the domain of the
  configuration file.  This has the added benefit of further allowing us to check if
  a static directory or router is the source of an error on application startup.

Deepti Sachi
------------
Visualization 1: Tracking tag usage by user and corresponding uploads by tag.
Visualization 2: Tracking viewer OR upload frequency over time. (note: whichever is easier to code for)
