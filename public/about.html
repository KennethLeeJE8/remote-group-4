        <p class="pt-2">
          Trace is a way for artists and other visual creators to manage exclusive access to their works and address the cases where somebody reuploads their work without permission.
        </p>

        <h3>Access management?</h3>
        <p>
          One of the common trends for visual artists is to sell exclusive early access to features such as in-progress works or special pictures to paying customers.
          Here at Trace, we provide the ability to create private image albums with a special emphasis on managing who does and who does not have access to your work.
          The reason why you should consider using Trace to host an image is because it better enables you to address the problem of image reuploading.

      <section class="row">
        <h3>Addressing image reuploading?</h3>
        <p>
          What makes the exclusive access arrangement dangerous for visual creators are those who take their paid version of your works and redistribute them for free.
          Although the problem itself is fully impossible to prevent so long as an image can be viewed by somebody other than the artist alone,
          Trace exists to make finding the source of your leaked images easier.
        </p>
        <p>
          To this end, we employ <a href="steganography.html">steganography</a>,
          the art of hiding information such as text or whole images in plain sight,
          to produce unique, hidden watermarks that are applied to the images that your customers view.
          When you discover an image has been leaked, you can upload the image back to us here at Trace,
          and automatically learn who among the private image circle downloaded the viewed image and ended up redistributing the image without your permission.
